Mpd is a netgraph(4) based implementation of the multi-link PPP
protocol for FreeBSD.  It is designed to be both fast and flexible.
It handles configuration and negotiation in user land, while routing
all data packets strictly in the kernel.  It supports several of
the numerous PPP sub-protocols and extensions, such as:

      Multi-link PPP capability 
      PAP, CHAP, MS-CHAP and EAP authentication 
      PPP compression and encryption
      IPCP and IPV6CP parameter negotiation
      
Mpd has support for many link types:

      Serial port modem
      Point-to-Point Tunnelling Protocol (PPTP)
      Layer Two Tunnelling Protocol (L2TP)
      PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE)
      PPP over TCP
      PPP over UDP
      PPP over specified netgraph(4) node
